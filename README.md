# Sales Dashboard Project

This repository contains the **Sales Dashboard Project**, which leverages Power BI for data visualization and reporting, along with MySQL, CSV files, and advanced DAX functions for efficient data analysis.

## Overview
The project involves the creation of an interactive **Sales Dashboard** using Power BI, aimed at helping stakeholders track and analyze key sales metrics. Data from **MySQL databases** and **CSV files** were cleaned, transformed, and integrated into Power BI. Advanced **DAX functions** were used to calculate KPIs, such as sales growth, customer segmentation, and profit margins, improving report performance and enabling better decision-making.

## Technologies Used
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **MySQL**: Data extraction and transformation using SQL queries.
- **CSV Files**: External data sources integrated into the dashboard.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Advanced calculations and measures for enhanced reporting.

## Key Features
- **Data Integration**: Consolidated sales data from MySQL and CSV files into Power BI.
- **KPI Calculations**: Created dynamic KPIs such as sales growth, customer segmentation, and profit margins using advanced DAX functions.
- **Efficiency Improvements**: Optimized the data model and DAX formulas, reducing report rendering time by **25%** and improving overall reporting efficiency by **30%**.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Designed a user-friendly interface to allow stakeholders to filter and drill down into the data for better insights.

## How to Use the Project

### Prerequisites
- **Power BI Desktop**: Download and install Power BI Desktop from the [official website](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).
- **MySQL Database**: Ensure access to a MySQL database. Modify the provided SQL queries to match your database structure if necessary.
- **CSV Files**: Sample CSV files are included in the `Data` folder. These should be placed in the same directory as the Power BI file or connected via Power Query.
